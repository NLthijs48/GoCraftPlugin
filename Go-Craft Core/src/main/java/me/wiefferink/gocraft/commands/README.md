# Commands
Contains the (standalone) commands used in the plugin. Commands are not registered in `plugin.yml`, but are dynamically registered instead, just like permissions, this keeps code and information about a command in 1 file. 

Commands still need to be added to the `GoCraft` class to instantiate them.
